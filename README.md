# Box-Automation-2022
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is really just a personal script to set up my vm in a pinch
This is used primarily for ubuntu feel free to clone and modify for your distro

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Primary Functionality 

- Create my basic file structure for tooling
- Populate the folders with common tools (windows binaries and powershell)
- download Sublime text editor
- Automate the setup of neo4j and Blood hound because it is a pain
	- this needs to be watched constantly for new versions
- Gets python setup for virtual envs
	- need to add functionality to add crackmap-venv like my main box has and other python tools
	- crackmap,impacket,responder,ldapdomaindump.py,bloodhound.py etc
